# Uncertainty Experiment (Not Trying Until Success)
#
# In this experiment, we expect to see an increasing failure rate. We will use
# the result to learn what upper bound to set for the test where we try until
# success.
#
# Scenario
# - TIGHTNESS_TIME_MEAN = 90
# - TIGHTNESS_TIME_DEVIATION = 30
# - END_TIME = 9 * 60 * 60
